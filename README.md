# Demonstrations for the **[meta-aws](https://github.com/aws/meta-aws)** project

[meta-aws](https://github.com/aws/meta-aws) is a [Yocto
Project](https://www.yoctoproject.org/) Bitbake Metadata Layer. It
accelerates building [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com)
(AWS) software you can install to [Embedded
Linux](https://elinux.org/Main_Page). Customers use this to build IoT
solutions on AWS.

In this repository, you will find
[meta-aws](https://github.com/aws/meta-aws) demonstrations.  These
demonstrations are both Poky (Yocto Project reference implementation)
based and real hardware based.  Many times, the hardware will be
representative of real use of hardware listed in the [AWS Device
Catalog](https://devices.amazonaws.com).

The number of demonstrations will increase over time and your
contribution is very welcome!

## How this repository is organized

The demonstrations in this repository can be categorized as either an
AWS service example or a use case example.  AWS service examples are
usually setup as basic `local.conf` driven examples on existing
reference distributions like Yocto Project's Poky. Use case examples
are usually more complete with a reference distribution for a target
EVB since they may have peripheral configuration specific to the use
case.

Every example has the following properties.

- Target operating environment (emulation, virtualization, or physical
  evaluation or development board)
- Included AWS device software

Every example has a build status that is derived by an AWS CodeBuild
outcome.

- Target Yocto Project or Automotive Grade Linux release
