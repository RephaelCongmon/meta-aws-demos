# Demonstrations for the **[meta-aws](https://github.com/aws/meta-aws)** project

[meta-aws](https://github.com/aws/meta-aws) is a [Yocto Project](https://www.yoctoproject.org/) Bitbake Metadata Layer. It accelerates building [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com) (AWS) software you can install to [Embedded Linux](https://elinux.org/Main_Page). Customers use this to build IoT solutions on AWS.

In this repository, you will find [meta-aws](https://github.com/aws/meta-aws) demonstrations.  These demonstrations are both Poky (Yocto Project reference implementation) based and real hardware based.  Many times, the hardware will be representative of real use of hardware listed in the [AWS Device Catalog](https://devices.amazonaws.com).

The number of demonstrations will increase over time and your contribution is very welcome!
